# HeLLo,
# While Making this Personal Portfolio Website, I've encountered many challenges, but it was my perseverance that with researching and gaining knowledge and with hit and trial method I've achieved the final look. The main challenge was in making the website completely responsive, suitable for all devices. Rest of the things were easy in terms of difficulty in making. But through constant process and hardwork and a comprehensive process of learning i would agree that I came across so many terms and theories of HTML and CSS and also lot more to explored.
# I hope that I would be able to justify all the tasks that were given in the problem statement.
#Awaiting your feedback
# Thank you
